# Daily Dev Log

This repository is automated to log daily development activities and maintain a consistent contribution history.

## How it works

A GitHub Action running on a schedule (5 times a day) updates the `daily-log.md` file and commits the changes back to the repository.

## Setup

1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Update `.github/workflows/daily.yml` with your Git Name and Email.
3. Enable "Read and write permissions" for GitHub Actions in your repo settings.
